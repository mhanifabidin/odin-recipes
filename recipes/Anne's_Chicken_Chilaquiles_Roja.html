    <h2>Anne's Chicken Chilaquiles Roja</h1>
    <img src='../images/anne_chicken_roja.jpeg'>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite comfort foods from growing up in Tucson.
        It's great for a potluck or party and you'll get lots of
        compliments from your guests!
        This is a "roja" version but there is a "verde" style,
         too. Both are great and can be made hot or mild depending 
         upon your heat tolerances or preferences. 
         Serve with your favorite salsa, if desired.</p>

        <li>1 large white onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 dash roasted ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 dash dried oregano</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package tortilla chips</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>5 ounces crumbled cotija cheese</li>
        <li>1 whole cooked chicken, deboned and shredded</li>
        <li>⅔ cup chopped green onions, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped cilantro, divided</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease a large (10x15-inch) casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Combine drained tomatoes and chipotle chiles in 
            adobo in a blender and puree until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Saute onion in hot oil until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Add garlic and saute 1 minute more. 
            Add pureed tomato-chile sauce and simmer until 
            mixture starts to thicken. 
            Pour in chicken broth and stir in cumin, oregano, and salt;
             let simmer until mixture thickens. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Mix tortilla chips and tomato-chile sauce, folding carefully to cover chips completely.
             You may have to do this in 2 batches.</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom of the casserole dish with half of the chip/sauce mixture. Sprinkle a layer of Mexican cheese and cotija cheese over top. Add shredded chicken to cover all of the chips and cheese. Season chicken with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with 1/2 of the green onions and 1/2 of the cilantro. Spoon 3/4 of the sour cream evenly over top. Spread with the remaining tortilla mixture then top with remaining
             Mexican and cotija cheeses. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until mixture is bubbly and cheese is melted, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. 
            Serve with sour cream, green onions, and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
